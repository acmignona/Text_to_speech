# Description:
This is a simple text-to-speech application that utilizes Google's Text-to-Speech Python library. This will generate an MP3 audio file with whatever text is entered within the GUI. I created this GUI for the Telecom team who had a need to use this library, but they weren't familiar with with how to use Python. Python code included for transparency, but not required to run executable. 

# How to use: 

1. Launch TTS_GUI.exe.
2. Enter the text to generate a corresponding speech audio file.
3. Click "Convert to Speech"
4. An MP3 file will be generated and saved in the relative path that the executable was launched in, unless otherwise defined.
